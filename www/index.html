<h1>Substance look & feel - Samples</h1>

<p>The goal of this project is to show how to use <a href="https://substance.dev.java.net">Substance
look-and-feel</a> and its APIs to create visually rich and modern user interfaces.

<h3>Cookbook</h3>

<p><strong>Cookbook</strong> is one of the winners of <a href="http://mydreamapp.com/">My 
Dream App contest</a>. While it never moved past 
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mydreamapp/sets/72157600046909364/">the design mockups</a> 
and private developer builds, it showed great attention to detail and painstaking polish in every UI element.
Here is one of the final Cookbook designs (click to see full view):</p>

<p>Here is the implementation of the same UI as a combination of a custom Substance skin 
and a small amount of application Java2D code that is using published Substance APIs to 
achieve a similar look using no images (click for full-size version):</p>
