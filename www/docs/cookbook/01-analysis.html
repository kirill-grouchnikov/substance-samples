<h1>Analyzing the original design</h1>

<h3>Identifying application decoration areas</h3>

<p>The first step in implementing a specific UI in Substance is identifying
the application <strong>decoration areas</strong>. Here is a thumbnail of the main 
Cookbook design:</p>

<p>This screen has four main decoration areas. The following screenshots
show a translucent light blue overlay to highlight each one of the areas.</p>

<p>The top portion of the application window is the <strong>header</strong>:</p>

<p>The bottom portion of the application window is the <strong>footer</strong>:</p>

<p>The left portion of the application window is the <strong>sidebar</strong>:</p>

<p>The center-right portion of the application window is the <strong>main</strong>:</p>

<h3>Identifying application functional areas</h3>

<p>Unlike the decoration areas that are primarily delineated by similar
colors and textures, the <strong>functional areas</strong> are delineated
primarily by the user-facing business logic. In Cookbook UI there are three
main functional areas (in addition to the general control area in the header):</p>

<p>Note how the functional areas and decoration areas are not identical. In fact,
every functional area intersects two decoration areas (and vice versa in most cases).
Here is the sidebar area in Cookbook UI:</p>

<p>Note that while the lists and footers have different visuals (colors, textures, 
gradients), they belong to the same functional group. For example, the footer controls
for the category list are located directly beneath it, and the footer panel itself
has the same width as the category list. This is especially true for dynamic scenarios
when the entire UI is resized or re-proportioned.</p>

<p>This step may cross the line between the pure design and the implementation
(Swing or other UI toolkits). As the developer, you will mostly be operating on the 
functional UI areas. It is important to understand that Substance supports the notion
of different decoration and functional areas. However, in some cases the certain 
limitations of the Substance decoration layer will impose some restrictions on the way
you structure the Swing hierarchy.</p>
