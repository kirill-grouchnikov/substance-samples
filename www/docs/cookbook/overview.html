<p><strong>Cookbook</strong> is one of the winners of <a href="http://mydreamapp.com/">My 
Dream App contest</a>. While it never moved past 
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mydreamapp/sets/72157600046909364/">the design mockups</a> 
and private developer builds, it showed great attention to detail and painstaking polish in every UI element.</p>

<p>Here is one of the final Cookbook designs (click to see full view):</p>
<p><a href="../../images/cookbook/original.png"><img class="aligncenter" src="../..//images/cookbook/original-thumb.png" height="268" width="480"></a></p>

<p>Here is a full-size version of the left part of this design:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="../../images/cookbook/original-zoom.png" alt="" height="633" width="500"></p>

<p>An incomplete list of small but important visual details that come together as a single well-tuned UI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous look of the title pane and the toolbar.</li>
<li>Similar texture and coloring of title pane / toolbar and the footer.</li>
<li>Different texture on the left side bar.</li>
<li>Two different panels on the left side bar (one of them is a scroll bar) sharing the same continuous texture and lights.</li>
<li>Vertical separators extending from the side bar panels to the footer bar, changing the color to match the relevant areas.</li>
<li>Continuous texture on the buttons in the toolbar and the footer.</li>
<li>Single borders (border strip) on the buttons in the toolbar and the footer.</li>
<li>The search text field in the footer is not using the same coloring as the footer itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the implementation of the same UI as a combination of a custom Substance skin 
and a small amount of application Java2D code that is using published Substance APIs to 
achieve a similar look using no images (click for full-size version):</p>

<p>and the full size version of the left side of the screen:</p>

<p>How would one start implementing such a UI with Substance?</p>

<li>Step 3 - <a href="03-decorations.html">implementing the decoration painting</a>.</li>
<li>Step 4 - <a href="04-skin.html">implementing the skin</a>.</li>
