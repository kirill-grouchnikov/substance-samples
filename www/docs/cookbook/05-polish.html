<h1>Polishing the visuals</h1>

<h3>Lather, rinse, repeat</h3>

<p>Unless you are using the exact same images that the designer was using
for creating the screen mockups, the process of implementing the required visuals
is hardly ever done. The slightest variations in color saturation, hues and brightness
can result in a drab appearance. Not paying attention to artfully placed 
visual separators (gaps, margins, borders) can result in a cluttered appearance.
Failing to remove visual noise that does not bother you as a programmer
can result in visual distractions for the users, even at the unconscious
level.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the very first implementation of Cookbook UI header
before all the visual tweaks introduced in the previous phases:</p>

<p>and here is the current implementation:</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the first implementation of Cookbook UI footer:</p>

<h3>The devil is in the details</h3>

<p>While the first two phases (<a href="01-analysis.html">analysis</a> and 
<a href="02-mapping.html">mapping</a>) operated on more abstract layers
(decoration areas, functional areas, container hierarchy), the implementation
phases (<a href="03-decoration.html">decoration</a> and 
<a href=04-skin.html">skin creation</a>) must pay painstaking attention to all the
minute details of the target design. Not closely following the design may seem
insignificant to the developer, but it will in most cases result in deteriorated
user experience.</p>

<p>The following is an incomplete list of Cookbook UI minute visuals that have
been pointed out before. Most of these can be easily addressed with Substance
<a href="https://substance.dev.java.net/docs/painters/overview.html">painters</a>
and 
<a href="https://substance.dev.java.net/docs/skins/overview.html">skins</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seamless and continuous texturing of header, footer and sidebar areas.</li>
  <li>Light-dark fill gradients for the buttons.</li>
  <li>Darker gradients for the button borders with translucent fading inner
  borders.</li>
  <li>Color schemes used for the selected buttons in the header and scroll bar in
  the sidebar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are two more examples of fine details that are easily missed at a cursory
glance. The following is a zoomed screenshot of the seam between the sidebar and
the footer area. The vertical separator has two lines, darker on the left and
lighter on the right. The same appies to the horizontal separator. In addition, the
horizontal separator is painted on top of the vertical one to further enforce
the boundary between the application functional areas:</p>

<img src="../../images/cookbook/05-polish/zoom-footer-cookbook.png" width=414 height=187>

<p>In the implementation, the vertical separators are painted as a custom border
installed on the relevant panels. While this can be achieved with the decoration 
painter, in this specific case it is easier to use borders and supported
Substance APIs (to fetch the color schemes). These borders are the only usage of
Substance APIs outside the self-contained definition of the custom skin. This is 
an example of the tradeoff between containing the painting routines inside the
skin definition and the limitations of the Substance skinning layer that impose
greater complexity on implementing this specific feature.</p>

<p>The next screenshot shows a zoomed version of the buttons in one of the footers:</p>

<img src="../../images/cookbook/05-polish/zoom-buttons-cookbook.png" width=397 height=107>

<p>In addition to the details on the gradient fill and the double border, there is 
one more important thing - the seamless appearance of the buttons as one joined
group. In order to implement this, i am using the 
<code><font color="darkblue">org.jvnet.flamingo.common.JCommandButtonStrip</font></code>
component from <a href="https://flamingo.dev.java.net">Flamingo</a> component suite
with the matching <a href="https://substance-flamingo.dev.java.net">Substance plugin</a>.
Buttons placed in the <code><font color="darkblue">JCommandButtonStrip</font></code>
will have continuous background, a single separator line between them and correct rounded
corners on the left / right buttons.</p>

<p>Using Flamingo also facilitates creation of custom icons for the header and footer
buttons. In this case, i am using the offline Flamingo 
<a href="http://www.pushing-pixels.org/?p=424">SVG transcoder</a> to transcode
a few icons from the <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Gallery">Tango
iconset</a> to pure Java2D based classes. A combination of a few 
<a href="http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters/index.html">filters</a> can make these
icons white with a darker halo shade.</p>

<h3>Even when you think you're done</h3>

<p>The process of defining, implementing and refining the visuals can take
a few iterations until both sides (design and implementation) are satisfied with
the results. In this process, paying attention to the work of the designer is as
important as handling all the corner cases in the business logic. Indeed, a few 
ill-advised pixels or a drab color scheme are not going to bring your application down.
However, if you are interested in providing an appealing and immersive flow to
your users, it is most certainly worth extra few days of investment.</p>
